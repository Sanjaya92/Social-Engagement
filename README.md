# Social-Engagement



## Description:
The "Social Engagement Analysis" project aims to analyze social media data from platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn to understand user engagement, impressions, reach patterns, trends, and sentiments. By analyzing data from these platforms, the project seeks to uncover insights that can help businesses or organizations improve their social media strategies.

## Dependencies:

This project relies on the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- plotly

## Usage:

1. Open the `social_engagement_analysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to connect to your PostgreSQL database and fetch the social media data.
3. Once the data is loaded, use Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and plotly for visualization and analysis purposes.
4. Explore different metrics such as engagement, impressions, reach, likes, shares, comments, and sentiment analysis across various social media platforms to gain insights into user behavior and interaction with social media content.

Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed and configured on your system before running the notebook. Additionally, ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed for visualization purposes.

**Note:** Some visualizations created using Plotly may not render interactively in the GitHub notebook viewer. To view these visualizations, you may need to run the notebook locally or use an external viewer that supports Plotly charts.
